    <h2>Welcome to my COVID-19 Blog where I am talking about what I've done over the summer of 2020 and how my plans have completely changed in the space of 3 months</h2>

    <h1>March 2020</h1>
    <p>
        In March 2020, my second term at university ended a week early. With this extra week, I decided to spend my extra time revising for my exams.
        Midway through my Easter break I was informed that I would not be returning to Southampton and I would instead be finishing the semester by completing my lectures virtually. With this news, and an increased amount of free time since the time I committed to societies was now free I decided to obtain a job working in a warehouse at nights. Working 9-5 at nights and then attending lectures during the day proved difficult, but thanks to time management and planning I manage to keep on track with my revision and complete my exams on time whilst working.
        In August, I was planning to take a flight to America to start a semester abroad studying at Penn State. In May, due to the current situation, I was informed that semester 1 abroad schemes have been cancelled and I would be returning to Southampton at the end of September. This left me with the entire summer with no plans since obtaining an internship proved extremely difficult with the schedule including my semester abroad. I decided that this summer I would develop my skills and commercial awareness and keep myself busy over the following months.

        This month was a busy month. Following through with my plans I decided to continue with my inside sherpa courses and also improving my understanding of financial modelling by creating financial statements for a couple companies and then create forecasts for those companies. I also had my DofE expedition during the hottest days of the year which was another elcomed challenge.
