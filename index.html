        I currently manage 2 virtual portfolios which have generated a 15% return during COVID-19, thanks to liquification in February and reinvestment into e-commerce such as Amazon and ASOS. I have also learnt about risk and its affect on stocks which has encouraged my diversification of my portfolio to cover ecommerce, retailers, real estate and even aviation. Aviation being the riskiest and only expected to be a long-term stock i.e. 5-year recovery.
